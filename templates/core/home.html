<!-- WHO IT'S FOR -->
<section class="home-section">
  <h2>Why businesses use MintKit Hub</h2>

  <h3>Built for real-world services <em>and</em> products</h3>
  <p>
    Hair &amp; beauty, gyms, trainers, tutors, local events, cafés, makers, small shops…
    Anyone who sells time, sessions, experiences or physical products and wants
    modern digital cards on top: gift cards, passes, memberships, tickets and vouchers.
  </p>

  <h3>Cards that behave like passes</h3>
  <p>
    Each digital card has a clear status (unused, redeemed, expired) and a QR code that can be
    scanned at the door, at the till, or wherever you validate access.
  </p>

  <h3>Lightweight, not a full shop system</h3>
  <p>
    You don't need a huge e-commerce platform. MintKit Hub focuses on one thing:
    selling and managing digital access in a clean way. Your existing website, socials or
    offline marketing can simply link to your MintKit storefront.
  </p>

<!-- FLOW OVERVIEW -->
<section class="home-section">
  <h2>What the flow looks like</h2>

  <h3>1. Set up your profile</h3>
  <p>
    Create an account, add your business name, contact details and logo.
    Your dashboard becomes the “control room” for everything else.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Publish your storefront</h3>
  <p>
    Add a short headline and description, decide if it's public, and share the link with your
    customers. No full website rebuild needed.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Create and manage digital cards</h3>
  <p>
    Use MintKit Studio to design the actual gift cards, tickets and vouchers.
    Customers buy them online; you scan and manage them from your own dashboard.
  </p>
