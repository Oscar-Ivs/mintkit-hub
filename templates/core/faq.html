          <summary class="mk-faq-q">Do my customers need a MintKit account?</summary>
          <div class="mk-faq-a">
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> No. Customers use your public storefront and open their card/ticket in a normal browser (phone or desktop).</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="mk-faq-item">
          <summary class="mk-faq-q">Do I need crypto, a wallet, or to buy tokens?</summary>
          <div class="mk-faq-a">
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> No. The goal is a normal SaaS-style experience. Any blockchain complexity stays behind the scenes.</p>

        </details>

        <details class="mk-faq-item">
          <summary class="mk-faq-q">What is the difference between MintKit Hub and MintKit Studio?</summary>
          <div class="mk-faq-a">
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Hub is the website for accounts, storefront and subscriptions. Studio is the separate app where digital products are created and managed.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

          <summary class="mk-faq-q">How do plans work in this college project?</summary>
          <div class="mk-faq-a">
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> A Free Trial is shown first, then a Basic plan. A Pro tier is displayed as “coming soon” to show the roadmap.</p>
            <p class="mk-faq-muted">Note: Stripe subscription checkout is implemented; some automation and Hub ↔ Studio gating is staged</p>

          <summary class="mk-faq-q">What happens when the free trial ends?</summary>
          <div class="mk-faq-a">
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Upgrading keeps full access. Without an active plan, editing/creating in Studio is intended to be limited or paused.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="mk-faq-item">
          <summary class="mk-faq-q">How do customers pay?</summary>
          <div class="mk-faq-a">
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> The intended flow is Stripe checkout in normal currency, then the customer receives access to the purchased digital product.</p>

          <div class="mk-faq-a">
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> The customer completes payment, then receives access (typically via an email link) to view and use their card/ticket.</p>
            <p class="mk-faq-muted">Email + QR/manual redemption flows are in beta / evolving” flow.</p>

    A deeper look at how MintKit Hub (Web2) and MintKit Studio (ICP/Web3) fit together.
    Some items are roadmap features for the full SaaS version.

    <summary class="mk-tech-q">Architecture at a glance</summary>
    <div class="mk-tech-a">
      <ul class="mk-tech-list">
        <li><strong>MintKit Hub (this site):</strong> Django dashboard for business profile, storefront layout, and plan UI. Stores settings in a traditional DB.</li>
        <li><strong>MintKit Studio (separate app):</strong> Internet Computer canisters handle minting logic, on-chain records, and card redemption flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Public delivery:</strong> cards can be shared via a link + QR/manual code, with public assets served from IC HTTP gateways/boundary nodes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mk-tech-muted">
        Goal: Hub stays simple for everyday users; Studio handles blockchain-grade integrity and long-term extensibility.

  <details class="mk-tech-block">
    <summary class="mk-tech-q">Identity, principals & access control</summary>
    <div class="mk-tech-a">
      <ul class="mk-tech-list">
        <li><strong>Internet Identity (II):</strong> users authenticate and act as a <em>principal</em> (IC identity).</li>
        <li><strong>Roles:</strong> access can be controlled by role (owner/admin/creator) so only authorised principals can mint, edit collections, or manage settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> actions can be attributed to a principal, which helps with traceability (who minted, who edited, who redeemed).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mk-tech-muted">
        Roadmap: richer permissions (staff roles per storefront, scoped access per collection, optional “read-only” support accounts).
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details class="mk-tech-block">
    <summary class="mk-tech-q">On-chain data model (what gets stored)</summary>
    <div class="mk-tech-a">
      <ul class="mk-tech-list">
        <li><strong>Collections:</strong> groups of cards (gift cards / tickets / vouchers) with limits and metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>Card templates:</strong> design/layout settings (backgrounds, text positions, styles) used to generate card outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Mint records:</strong> created items can store references like <em>public image URL</em>, <em>public metadata URL</em>, plus redemption fields (QR/manual codes).</li>
        <li><strong>Redemption events (optional):</strong> append-only logs for “redeemed / when / by which method”, useful for reporting and dispute resolution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mk-tech-muted">
        IC canisters are designed to be upgraded; stable storage patterns help preserve critical records across upgrades.

        <li><strong>Card images:</strong> stored and served via IC-compatible asset hosting (asset canister / gateway approach).</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> JSON metadata can be published alongside images (useful for wallets, explorers, and future integrations).</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> public assets can be cached at the edge (boundary nodes), keeping loads fast for customers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mk-tech-muted">
        Roadmap: signed URLs / access rules for “private previews”, plus optional encryption for sensitive payloads.

  <details class="mk-tech-block">
    <summary class="mk-tech-q">Redemption flow (QR + manual code)</summary>
    <div class="mk-tech-a">
      <ul class="mk-tech-list">
        <li><strong>Two methods:</strong> QR scanning for speed + manual code as a fallback (useful for damaged prints or low light).</li>
        <li><strong>State machine:</strong> valid → redeemed (or expired/void), preventing double-spend style re-use.</li>
        <li><strong>Staff tooling:</strong> scanner view can validate and mark redeemed with clear feedback.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mk-tech-muted">
        Roadmap: “dynamic QR” (rotating codes) for stronger anti-screenshot protection, plus offline redemption modes for venues with poor signal.

    <summary class="mk-tech-q">Payments roadmap (Stripe + beyond)</summary>
    <div class="mk-tech-a">
      <ul class="mk-tech-list">
        <li><strong>Hub subscriptions:</strong> Stripe plans (free trial → paid tier) for access control and limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction fees:</strong> optional platform fee per sale (real SaaS model; currently simplified for the college version).</li>
        <li><strong>Micropayments (x402):</strong> future option to support pay-per-action APIs (e.g., pay per mint / pay per redemption verification) using HTTP-402 style flows.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mk-tech-muted">
        For the project submission: pricing UI demonstrates a realistic model even if billing automation is staged.

    <summary class="mk-tech-q">Privacy & security roadmap (VetKeys, VC, geolocation)</summary>
    <div class="mk-tech-a">
      <ul class="mk-tech-list">
        <li><strong>VetKeys:</strong> threshold-style key derivation for encrypting sensitive data while keeping verifiable on-chain state.</li>
        <li><strong>Verifiable Credentials:</strong> prove “this is a real business / verified organiser” without exposing unnecessary personal info.</li>
        <li><strong>Geolocation rules:</strong> optional constraints for redemptions (example: only redeem at venue / region), with careful UX so it doesn’t block legitimate customers.</li>

    <h3 class="mk-tech-subtitle">Operational notes</h3>
    <p class="mk-tech-muted">
      ICP canisters run on cycles (compute budget). Production readiness includes monitoring, upgrade strategy,
      sensible limits, and clear separation between “Hub settings” and “Studio minting/redemption” responsibilities.
