  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <p>
    This page answers common questions about how MintKit Hub and the MintKit Studio
    app fit together - first in simple terms, then (optionally) with more technical
    details for anyone who is curious.
  </p>

  <!-- 1. Getting started -->
  <h2>Getting started</h2>

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>Do my customers need a MintKit account?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      No. Your customers only see your public storefront and the digital cards or
      tickets they receive by email. They don't need to register or install an app.
    </p>
    <details class="faq-advanced">
      <summary>Show technical details</summary>
      <p>
        When a customer buys a card or ticket, MintKit creates a unique, secret
        link for that specific asset. That link is sent by email and can be opened
        in a normal browser on phone or desktop. Under the hood, the card is
        backed by a token/NFT on a blockchain, but the customer never has to deal
        with seed phrases, wallets or exchanges.

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>What is the difference between MintKit Hub and MintKit Studio?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      MintKit Hub (this website) is where you manage your account, subscription
      and storefront. MintKit Studio is a separate app where the actual digital
      gift cards, tickets and vouchers are created, minted and managed.
    </p>
    <details class="faq-advanced">
      <summary>Show technical details</summary>
      <p>
        MintKit Hub is a classic Web 2 Django site (accounts, forms,
        Stripe, storefront management). MintKit Studio runs on a blockchain
        platform and handles the “heavy” cryptographic work - minting tokens,
        storing card metadata and serving secure QR codes. Hub simply controls
        who is allowed to open Studio and keeps a record of which business
        profile is linked to which on-chain identity.
      </p>

  <!-- 2. Payments & pricing -->
  <h2>Payments & pricing</h2>

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>How do I pay for MintKit?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      You subscribe to a plan (after a free trial) using Stripe. Payments are
      taken in normal currency.
    </p>
    <details class="faq-advanced">
      <summary>Show technical details</summary>
      <p>
        Stripe handles all card details on its own hosted pages. MintKit Hub only
        stores the minimum Stripe IDs needed to know which plan you are on and
        whether your subscription is active. Blockchain transaction fees and
        storage costs are bundled into MintKit's platform fee and are never billed
        to you separately.
      </p>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>What happens when my free trial ends?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      You can upgrade to a paid plan to keep full access. If you don't upgrade,
      your storefront stays in place but access to MintKit Studio and minting
      tools is limited or paused.
    </p>
    <details class="faq-advanced">
      <summary>Show technical details</summary>
      <p>
        Internally, MintKit Hub stores the start and end date of your trial.
        Once the trial passes and there is no active subscription, the
        app will restrict user from editing/creating/minting or managing digital cards. Existing cards remain valid; you
        simply cannot create new ones or manage existing ones until you re-activate a plan.
      </p>

  <!-- 3. Storefronts & customers -->
  <h2>Storefronts & customers</h2>

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>Can I hide my storefront while I am still setting things up?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      Yes. You can keep your storefront inactive so only you can see it. When you are ready you switch it to active and it becomes
      publicly visible.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>What happens when a customer buys a card or ticket?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      The customer pays through Stripe, and then receives an email containing a
      secure link and QR code for their digital card or ticket.
    </p>
    <details class="faq-advanced">
      <summary>Show technical details</summary>
      <p>
        Depending on the chosen flow, cards can be pre-minted in batches or
        minted “on claim” when a customer activates their purchase via email.
        Either way, each card is represented by a unique on-chain token and
        linked to a short, human-friendly web page that the customer uses in
        everyday life.

  <!-- 4. For the curious / technical -->
  <h2>For the curious & technically minded</h2>

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>Why does MintKit use a blockchain at all?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      To give your digital cards properties that normal databases can't easily
      guarantee - uniqueness, tamper-resistance, and long-term verifiability -
      while still keeping the experience simple for you and your customers.
    </p>
    <details class="faq-advanced">
      <summary>Show technical details</summary>
      <p>
        MintKit Studio runs on a modern smart-contract platform based on the
        Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain. Your project lives inside isolated
        smart-contract containers (“canisters”) that are replicated across
        multiple independent nodes in different data centres. There is no single
        database or traditional web server that can be accidentally wiped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each card or ticket is effectively an NFT or token with structured
        metadata (value, expiry, status, usage history). Smart-contract logic
        enforces basic rules such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>only one active owner at a time,</li>
        <li>limited lifetime or expiry date,</li>
        <li>single-use or multi-use access, and</li>
        <li>optional transfer or resale limits (planned feature).</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-group">
    <h3>Can tickets be tied to a person, place or time?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Short answer:</strong>
      The current project focuses on simple “show and scan” digital cards. The
      roadmap includes tighter controls such as name-locking, time windows or
      location hints for specific card types.
    </p>
    <details class="faq-advanced">
      <summary>Show technical details</summary>
      <p>
        Because the underlying token logic is programmable, future versions can
        support richer policies, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Linking a ticket to an email, phone number or verified identity
          (so resale is limited or recorded).
        </li>
        <li>
          Time-window access (valid only between specific dates or event times).
        </li>
        <li>
          Geo-hints or venue-bound passes that are intended to be scanned only
          in certain locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rules around resale - for example, a maximum markup, or a limited
          number of allowed transfers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These features build on the same cryptographic foundation without
        changing the basic experience for the end user: they still just tap a
        link or show a QR code.
      </p>

  <!-- 5. End-to-end explanation -->
  <h2>How everything fits together (A-Z overview)</h2>

  <details class="faq-advanced">
    <summary>Click to see the full end-to-end flow</summary>
    <ol>
      <li>You register on <strong>MintKit Hub</strong> and create your profile.</li>
      <li>You set up your <strong>storefront</strong> (name, description, logo, basic text).</li>
      <li>You start a <strong>trial</strong> or subscription via Stripe.</li>
      <li>From your dashboard you open <strong>MintKit Studio</strong>, which knows which
          business profile and subscription plan you belong to.</li>
      <li>In Studio you design your digital products - gift cards, tickets or vouchers -
          and decide which ones should appear on your storefront.</li>
      <li>
        Customers visit your storefront, follow links to buy, pay via Stripe and
        receive an email with a secure card/ticket link backed by a token on the
        blockchain.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the card is used or scanned, Studio checks the token's status and
        business rules (valid, expired, already used, transferable, etc.) and
        responds accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        In future versions, Hub and Studio will exchange more data - for
        example simple stats such as total cards minted, sold and redeemed -
        so you can see a high-level view directly on your MintKit Hub dashboard.
      </li>
    </ol>
