  <h1>About MintKit Hub</h1>

  <p>
    MintKit Hub is the control centre for creating and managing digital gift cards, tickets and vouchers.
    It connects a familiar Web 2 dashboard experience (this site) with Web 3 technology running on blockchain infrastructure.
  </p>

    <li>Choose which digital cards to feature on the storefront.</li>
    <li>Connect payments (Stripe integration).</li>
    <li>View basic stats and manage a subscription.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>MintKit Studio (on-chain minting studio)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Secure minting of digital cards as NFTs/tokens.</li>
    <li>Asset storage on dedicated blockchain infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Admin tools for testing, previewing and managing cards.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Who is MintKit for?</h2>
  <p>
    MintKit is designed for small businesses and creators who want to offer modern digital cards without building their own Web 3 stack:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hairdressers, beauty salons and barbers.</li>
    <li>Cafés, restaurants and food trucks.</li>
    <li>Gyms, sports clubs and community centres.</li>
    <li>Event organisers and ticketed experiences.</li>
    <li>Independent creators who sell access passes or digital rewards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How it works in practice</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a business profile and storefront in MintKit Hub.</li>
    <li>Add one or more featured digital cards (gift cards, tickets, vouchers).</li>
    <li>Share the public storefront link with customers.</li>
    <li>Customers buy through the storefront (payments), and cards are issued and managed through the platform.</li>
  </ol>
