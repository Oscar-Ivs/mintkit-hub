  <h1>About MintKit Hub</h1>

  <p>
    MintKit Hub is your control centre for creating and managing
    <strong>digital gift cards, tickets and vouchers</strong>.
    It connects a familiar Web 2 experience (this dashboard) with
    Web&nbsp;3 technology running on the blockchain.
  </p>

  <h2>Two parts, one platform</h2>

  <h3>MintKit Hub (this site)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sign up and manage your business profile.</li>
    <li>Create and edit your public storefront page.</li>
    <li>Configure which digital cards you want to offer.</li>
    <li>Connect payments via Stripe.</li>
    <li>View basic stats and manage your subscription.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>MintKit Studio (on-chain Minting Studio)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Secure minting of your digital cards as NFTs/tokens.</li>
    <li>Asset storage on the Internet Computer blockchain.</li>
    <li>Admin tools for testing, previewing and managing cards.</li>
    <li>Future features such as advanced analytics and VetKeys-style
        offline redemption.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who is MintKit for?</h2>
  <p>MintKit is designed for small businesses and creators who want to offer
     modern digital cards without building their own Web 3 stack:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hairdressers, beauty salons and barbers.</li>
    <li>Cafés, restaurants and food trucks.</li>
    <li>Gyms, sports clubs and community centres.</li>
    <li>Event organisers and ticketed experiences.</li>
    <li>Independent creators who sell access passes or digital rewards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How it works in practice</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You create a business profile and storefront here in MintKit Hub.</li>
    <li>You define one or more digital cards (gift cards, tickets or vouchers).</li>
    <li>Your customers buy cards via your storefront (Stripe payments).</li>
    <li>Each card is linked to a secure asset minted via MintKit Studio.</li>
    <li>The customer receives an email with a direct link to digital card & dynamic QR code.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    For the college project, some parts are implemented as working stubs
    (for example Stripe and advanced analytics). The core flows - business
    profile, storefront management and the bridge to MintKit Studio - are
    the focus of this version.
